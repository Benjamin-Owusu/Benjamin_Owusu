Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher, I bring deep expertise in econometric and statistical modeling, causal inference, and machine learning, with hands-on experience using tools such as Python and R for data analysis and predictive modeling.

My professional experience has also honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, particularly in the context of business operations and strategic decision-making. I am passionate about applying data-driven insights to tackle complex economic and business challenges and am enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities where I can make a meaningful impact."
