In this post, I predict the German inflation rate using Exponential Smoothing and simple ARIMA models. I begin by exploring the dataset, examining seasonal trends, and assessing model fit. I then detail the model selection process, comparing the performance and forecast accuracy of both methodologies. The analysis provides insights into short-term inflation dynamics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach.
Check the above link which leads directly to the notebook.
