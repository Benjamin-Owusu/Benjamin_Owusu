# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to identify facets of a particular population (from the data) that are more likely to purchase products in a mailout campaign for a mail-order company. The idea is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

Prior to applying the machine learning methods, it is necessary to assess and clean the data to convert it into a usable form.

## Main Steps

### Preprocessing of Data
  - Assess Missing Data
  - Selection and Re-Encoding Features
  - Creation of a Cleaning Function
### Feature Transformation
  - Feature Scaling
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)    
### Clustering
